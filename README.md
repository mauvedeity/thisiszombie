# thisiszombie
This is the basic zombie code that posts to Twitter.

All it does is say "`braaaaains` #zombie", with random numbers of 'a' characters. Oh, and it sometimes says it in French, German, or Spanish. Sometimes it gets retweeted by other Internet zombie characters, which is most amusing.

## Dependencies

This code depends on [ttytter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/), available from the source [here](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/).
